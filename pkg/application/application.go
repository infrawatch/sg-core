//package application defines the interfaces for interacting with application plugins

// Application describes application plugin interfaces.
// Configuration bytes are passed into the Config() function as a sequence of bytes in yaml format. It is recommended to use the config.ParseConfig() method to parse the input. This is a convenience method that uses the validations library to validate the input and provide specific feedback.
// The main process must be implemented in the Run() method and respect the context.Done() signal. If the plugin wishes to send an exit signal to sg-core, it must send a true value to the boolean channel. This should be done in the case of plugin failure.

	//The last two arguments are gauranteed to be the same size and map index to index. Implementors of this function should run as quickly as possible as metrics can be very high volume. It is recommended to cache metrics in a data.Metric{} object to be utilized by the application plugin later.
